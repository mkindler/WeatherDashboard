# WeatherDashboard

## Description

This project utilizes dynamically updated `HTML` and `CSS` powered by `jQuery` to create a basic weather dashboard application that allows a traveler to search for and view the current weather and extended forecast for whichever city/cities to which they will travel.  In addition to `jQuery`, `Bootstrap` is used to format the layout of the overall dashboard.

## Task

The weather dashboard application must display and perform the following:
* Search function for a traveler to look up the weather of the desired city/cities
* Ability to display the current weather and a 5-day extended forecast of the desired city/cities
* Ability to display previously searched cities, which are saved to and called from local storage
* Displayed weather of most recently searched city, as well as a list of previously searched cities when the application is refreshed

## Usage

This application can be used by travelers who would like to know the current weather and 5-day extended forecast for any cities to which they plan to travel.  The traveler will be provided with the following data:
* Current weather of the city, including a visual of current conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index
* 5-day forecast of the city, including a visual of expected conditions, temperature, and humidity

## Installation

This project will require a user to have:
* `Git Bash` (Windows), `Terminal` (Mac), or another application for executing commands to/from one's local machine.
* Code editor installed, such as `Visual Studio Code`.
* Access to `Bootstrap`, which is freely available online at https://getbootstrap.com/.
* The Open Weather API, which is freely available online at https://openweathermap.org/.
* Version control system, such as `GitHub`, to fork, clone, push, and pull the original repository, and to upload the final project to one's own version control system account.

## Process

This project was designed from scratch and included the creation of `HTML`, `CSS`, and `jQuery`.
